# Archived - Scala Macros

This project is no longer under development.
If you need to write macros today use scala-reflect, the macro system that is included with the Scala compiler, is used by most major libraries and is documented here https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/overview.html.
Stay tuned for updates on macro support in Dotty,
